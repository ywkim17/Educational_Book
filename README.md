Setting Up Computer for Programming

To program the simulation, you will need to set up a python integrated environment. There are three main components to achieve this:
1. Python Interpreter
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
3. Python Extension

The first step is to install a Python Interpreter on your computer by going to this site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. If you are a Windows user, all you need to do is click the “Download for Windows” button for the latest version.
2. If you are a MacOS user, Python is not supported. A package management system is required (e.g. Homebrew). To install Python using Homebrew, type “brew install python3” on the Terminal prompt. To check if Python is installed onto your Mac, type the command "python3 --version” on Terminal. If Python is installed, you will receive a message that tells you which version you have. If Python is not installed, you will see “command not found: python” on your terminal.

Next step is to download an IDE for your code to be compiled on. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a commonly used IDE. You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Finally, to install a Python Extension onto your IDE, click on the extensions icon on the left sidebar of the VSCode platform. Search “Python” and download the extension.

Now, you can go to your explorer and create a new Python file with a “.py” ending. You are now ready to program!

Running the Nernst Equation File

If you have not already, create a GitHub account. Once logged in, go to this link: https://github.com/ywkim17/Educational_Book/blob/main/Nernst.py

Download the code named “Nernst.py” and run it on your VSCode software. You can now run simulations through your computer!

Running the GHK Simulation File

If you have not already, create a GitHub account. Once logged in, go to this link: 
https://github.com/ywkim17/Educational_Book/blob/main/GHK.py

Download the code named “GHK.py” and run it on your VSCode software. You can now run simulations through your computer!
